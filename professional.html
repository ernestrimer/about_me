        Professional Bio
      </h3>
        <p>
          I started my career as a strength & conditioning coach: the person responsible for getting athletes into shape.  After a 12 year pursuit, during which time I witnessed many champions, I made the switch to sport science, the study of sport.  It's my mission to use evidence-informed practice to maximize the health, safety, and performance of athletes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I have become quite good at developing sophisticated strenth & conditioning management systems using Microsoft Excel.  I'm taking this course because while I have the proper domain expertise, I don't know how to express it with anything other than Excel.  In fact, I have always dreamed of sharing my knowledge through the development of a strength and conditioning management software.  I am a co-founder of a local startup, FYTT, and I hope this course will allow me to contribute to the development of our software.
        </p>
        <P>
          I have a PhD in Exercise Physiology, which serves me well as a sport science consultant and professional speaker.  I have consulted with numerous elite sport organizations and have spoken at dozens of international, national, regional, and state sports performance conferences.
