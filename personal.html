          From Bisbee, Arizona, where I'm from, I worked my way north to Flagstaff, Arizona where I attended Northern Arizona University and completed my bachelor's and master's degrees. From Flagstaff, we (my future bride and me) continued working our way north to Park City, Utah (2007-2009), and then made our final stop in Salt Lake City (2009), where we live today.

      <h3>
        My Family
      </h3>
        <p>
          My wife Alyssa and I have been together for almost 20 years! Our oldest daughter Veronika will begin her senior year at the University of Utah in August.  Our daughter Layla will begin kindegarten in the fall, and I hope our toddler Max will begin using the toilet soon.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Our Travels
        </h3>
          <p>
            Some people won't afford travel.  We always have.  The places and the memories are worth more than the money.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've traveled together to Astoria (where the Goonies are from), Maui, Yellowstone, Rome, Athens, the Virgin Islands, Nicaragua, Brazil, Manhattan, Scotland, and Tahoe.  Veronika got to go to Maui with us.  Layla had to come to Mahattan with us (she was just a baby), and Max came along for the ride in Scotland (we were pregnant).  Even though Grandma watched the kids during the rest of our trips, we planned to bring them to Austin and Orlando this year until coronovirus made us stay home.
          </p>  
          <p>
            Aside from the trips we've done together, Alyssa has been to Paris, and I have been to Sydney, Bratislava, London, Venice, and Dublin.  I'm way cooler than she is.

            We drink a lot of it so I thought it deserved it's own section with a larger heading.
